## Project Description
SkateUs was built to support the Figure Skating community on the challenges of running efficently in today's "on-line world".

## Project User Story
As an ice-rink owner I want a react website with a learning program and testing submition page for Free Skate and Moves On The Field, as well as profiles for coaches and students with schedule management. 
It needs to have a section for job opportunities at the rink, events for the community to assist, resorces and conferences information for coaches.
