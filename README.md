## Motivation for Deployment
Due to Covid we all had to skip forward into the future where most things are done online, sports are not a exception, that's why this application was done, to fill the need for a more convenient way to let skaters pass their rigorous tests.

## User story
As an Ice Skating student I need an application that teaches me how to pass my freekste test. Given the application I need to learn what elements I need, to pass my test. Given the elements, I need a step by step tutorial on how to perform the steps correctly, as well as video demonstrations of each element. And I need the application to let me submit a video recording of my test to be evaluated.
