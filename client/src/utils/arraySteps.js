        mainText: "In order to make a good footwork sequence, it’s important to use a variety of turns that you’ve learned throughout your skating journey, clusters are the bread and butter of this element, chaining together multiple turns in order to execute a cluster. The most common is a rocker-counter-twizzle cluster as demonstrated in this video. Here’s how to master it!",
        pasos: [
            "1- Practice your rocker turn by starting on a right forward inside edge with your arms over the circle",
            "2- once you’re on your edge, press the big toe and rock up to the front of the blade to initiate the turn, rotating over your left shoulder, inside the circle",
            "3- to exit the turn on the correct edge, continue pressing the big toe, and let the back inside edge curve away from the circle you started on.",
            "4- Practice your back counter turn by starting on a right back inside edge, with your arms over the circle",
            "5- since this turn is going from backwards to forward, we’ll want to press our heal to flip our toes around and turn forward as we begin to execute this turn",
            "6- Remain on an inside edge as you turn forward, again pressing the big toe the whole time and feel yourself curve away from your original circle",
            "7- Practice your twizzle by starting on a right forward inside edge, and then curving the edge around to almost imitate a 3-turn, followed by rapidly turning forward again using the back of the blade, this creates rotation by manipulating the position on the blade. Keep your arms as square as you can during this turn.",

            "5- to get to our back sit position, we must simply change feet, to do this we have to open up our right side, keeping the left in front, and step our right leg directly under our right hip, pushing with the left foot to snap into our back sit",

            "4- as the right leg comes through, it tucks under and down, allowing us to convert to our backspin position in the air, this creates the first half of rotations",

There are many ways to enter this jump as well, the mohawk I execute in this video is actually more rare, but I quite enjoy its timing. Regardless if you do mohawk push back, outside 3-turn push back, or inside 3-turn, we all have to hit our power angle, so that is where we will start our focus",
