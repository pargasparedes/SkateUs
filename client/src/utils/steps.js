0-Intro
    This is a step by step guide on what you’ll need to work on in order to pass your Junior freeskate test. Thanks for coming to skate with me!

1-Footwork
In order to make a good footwork sequence, it’s important to use a variety of turns that you’ve learned throughout your skating journey, clusters are the bread and butter of this element, chaining together multiple turns in order to execute a cluster. The most common is a rocker-counter-twizzle cluster as demonstrated in this video. Here’s how to master it!
 1- Practice your rocker turn by starting on a right forward inside edge with your arms over the circle
 2- once you’re on your edge, press the big toe and rock up to the front of the blade to initiate the turn, rotating over your left shoulder, inside the circle
 3- to exit the turn on the correct edge, continue pressing the big toe, and let the back inside edge curve away from the circle you started on.
 4- Practice your back counter turn by starting on a right back inside edge, with your arms over the circle
 5- since this turn is going from backwards to forward, we’ll want to press our heal to flip our toes around and turn forward as we begin to execute this turn
 6- Remain on an inside edge as you turn forward, again pressing the big toe the whole time and feel yourself curve away from your original circle
 7- Practice your twizzle by starting on a right forward inside edge, and then curving the edge around to almost imitate a 3-turn, followed by rapidly turning forward again using the back of the blade, this creates rotation by manipulating the position on the blade. Keep your arms as square as you can during this turn.
 8- String them all together!

2-Solo Spin
For this solo spin, I decided to do a layback spin, a commonly used upright position that is iconic in figure skating. Here’s how to master it!
 1- After winding up with our back crossover, we step forward onto our heel on a left forward outside edge, keeping our left arm in front
 2- we increase our knee bend and rock up to the toe of the blade in order to hook and center the spin, keeping our left arm in front, and bringing our right side around to the front
 3- once we are spinning, we then take our right leg and reach it back behind us, turning our knee out, I like to think of it as a scorpion’s tail, but side ways!
 4- now it’s time to push our hips as forward as they can go, this is the foundation of the layback.
 5- as our hips go forward, our shoulders and head go back, creating a C shape with our body from our head to our free foot.
 6- bring the arms straight in to the center of the chest, and then once you’ve bent back, send them straight up to the ceiling for that classic silhouette!

3-Combo Spin
A combo spin must utilize all 3 basic positions, camel, sit, and upright. Here I do a camel, sit, back sit, back spin in order to achieve this. Technically the back sit is not required, but it helps achieve the necessary rotations, 5 on each foot
 1- the only difference in the entrance from our solo spin, is that we are starting a camel, so we must have our upper body a little more forward, bent over with a flat back
 2- then as we initiate our 3-turn to start the spin, we rise up in our skating knee, achieving and maintaining a camel position, keeping the left arm in front at all times
 3- now to go from camel, to sit. We must first start to bring our upper body slightly up in order to initiate the change of position
 4- then we swing our right leg and arm around to meet in our center, bending our skating knee and ankle to achieve the 90 degree angle to get a legal sit spin
 5- to get to our back sit position, we must simply change feet, to do this we have to open up our right side, keeping the left in front, and step our right leg directly under our right hip, pushing with the left foot to snap into our back sit
 6- then simply rise up into your basic back scratch position

4-Flying Spin
For the last of our spins, we have to fly. I chose to do a flying camel. Here’s how you can too! we step into this spin very similarly to the camel spin, however instead of doing our 3-turn to initiate the spin, we jump to our other foot
 1- once you reach the point of the 3-turn after you perform your entry into this spin, you want to swing your right leg around yourself
 2- this will help you leap off your left foot, which will then need to be lifted into the air as you hop to your right
 3- once you land on the right, pull into your back camel spin quickly so you don’t lose any momentum!
5-Single Axel
Now it’s time to jump, we are going to start with our only single jump performed on this test, the single axel. 1 and 1\2 rotations in the air, and the only jump with a forward take off
 1- start by gliding backwards on a right back outside edge, arms outside the circle
 2- step onto a left forward outside edge, making sure you step closer to the heel of the blade
 3- as you step, your arms and your right leg will pull back, as you rock up to the toe pick for take off, your arms and free leg will follow, reaching their peak as we hit our toe pick to take off forward, with the left arm going slightly across the body to the right
 4- as the right leg comes through, it tucks under and down, allowing us to convert to our backspin position in the air, this creates the first 1\2 of rotations
 5- now once we have converted, we hold our air position for what is the equivalent of a single loop jump at this point. Landing on our right foot, and checking out of our jump over the right side!

6-Double Loop
The first double we did was a double loop jumps, 2 full rotations in the air, and the first jump we learn that takes off, and lands on the right foot! 
 1-we start on our right back outside edge, being extremely stacked over our right side, left shoulder, arm, and leg in front
 2- now we have to curve off our circle, one of three. In order to do this, we must increase our knee bend without releasing the left side
 3- as we reach our maximum with how much we have to load, our circle has become so small, that we have no choice but to pivot, and launch into the air more forward than it might appear.
 4- make sure your left side does not pull you around your circle, once you are in the air your simply fold into and stay in your back spin position!

7-Double Salchow
Our next double is a salchow, invented by Ulrich Salchow, and one of my favorites. thanks Ulrich! There are a couple ways to enter this jump, I choose to do mine from a forward 3 turn
 1- after we step forward from the same right back outside edge we took for our axel, we make sure that our left arm is in front as we begin to do this 3-turn that will decide our timing for this jump.
 2-as we turn, our right arm comes to meet the left, only to quickly be pulled back upon completion of the turn, in order to strongly check over our right side with our right leg also remaining back behind us
 3- as this is also an edge jump, we must curl off our circle, this is done with knee and ankle bend.
 4- as we bend and make our circle smaller, another pivot point happens, and that is when we essentially jump forward off our toe pick, it is very similar to an axel at this point!
 5- from here, we convert into our back spin position, as this is a left foot jump so conversion is a must, then, spin and land! Making sure to hit a proper impact position, also known as “the Eagle” position in yoga!

8-Double Toe-Loop
Next is toe loop, the first toe jump we’ve talked about today! And the only left foot toe jump. There are many ways to enter this jump as well, the mohawk I execute in this video is actually more rare, but I quite enjoy its timing. Regardless if you do mohawk push back, outside 3-turn push back, or inside 3-turn, we all have to hit our power angle, so that is where we will start our focus
 1- after we have done our preferred entry steps, we are loading over our right leg, with a strong check to our right side, which we plan on landing on
 2- we have to reach back with our left foot, striking the ice with our toe pick, requiring us to point it somewhat to make sure we anchor ourselves properly
 3- with our left arm in front, it’s easy to think about this jump as starting by getting our left hand, and left foot, as far away from each other as possible, only to draw together to create rotation
 4- as we draw the right foot to the left pick, it’s important we bring the HEEL through, and not turn forward before we launch into the air too much, this will result in a big deduction as it is a common mistake called a toe-axel
 5- we have to make sure our right hip is flexible, in order to pull that heel to our pick and help launch us into the air
 6-, after we have transferred our weight to our left toe pick, and kicked our heel through, it’s time to convert to our back spin! Then follow the steps we covered previously. All jumps are the same after take off!

9-Double Flip
Our last solo double, and the most important one on this test. The flip! My all time favorite jump, as when it’s done right, there’s really no feeling like it! The flip is one of 2 toe pick jumps on the right foot, the other being the Lutz jump. This is another one with different entries, I like to do a 3-turn, but you can also do this with a mohawk!
 1-, after we execute our 3-turn, similar to the 3-turn for our salchow, we must bend our left knee to load, this combined with straight right leg extended behind us, will help dictate where we want to place our pick in the ice.
 2- as we tap our right to pick into the ice, we want to keep some weight on our left foot as we draw it to our right picking foot, because if we shift our weight too early, we will be completely off axis!
 3- it is important that we envision ourselves drawing this left foot on an inside edge, but not around the pick. It goes through, or “up and over” similar to the concept of poll vaulting
 4-once we have our left foot drawn to our picking foot, we launch into the air pivoting forward, and pulling into our back spin position. Don’t forget to keep that left arm in front on the take off!

10-Double Salchow-Double Loop Combo
For a combo, a lot is the same, you can apply both things from the salchow section, and loop section here. The main difference is what we do in between. Along with keeping that first jump long and low, and not too explosive in height.
 1- after landing the salchow in our eagle position, we have to open up slightly, but extremely to the right.
 2- we are already on our smallest circle for the loop that we talked about earlier, all we have to do is pivot!
 3- make sure you land on a soft knee from the salchow, if you land too low, it will kill your momentum. Timing is key in loop combos, any hesitation will throw it off entirely. They’re very delicate! Fragile, handle with care

11-Outro
And those are some tips on what to think about when working on elements for your junior freeskate. Thanks so much for watching and reading.
